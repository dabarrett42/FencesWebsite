												<h2>FAQ</h2>

											<header>
												<h3>What are the basic materials?</h3>

											<!--<h3>And Yet Another Subheading</h3>-->
											<p>Basic fence materials for residential use include pressure treated or cedar wood (picket, estate,
											and privacy), rustic split rail with wire mesh, classic ornamental aluminum, or steel fence, metal 
											chain link, and polyvinyl chloride(PVC) fences.</p>

												<h3>What kind of fasteners do you use?</h3>
												
											<p>We use ring shanked, or stainless steel nails approved for the new MCQ pressure treating 
											process. Stainless nails are required when using cedar. However, we do use screws and bolts when necessary to 
											make gates and decks stronger. Composite decks require screws and are recommended on wood decks.
											</p>
											
												<h3>Which is better, cedar or pressure treated materials?</h3>
												
											<p>The basic differences between cedar and pressure treated materials are the life and visual appearance of the 
											lumber. Cedar, usually western red, is a dense, yet light material with a tendency to resist rotting and 
											infestation. While cedar is a sometimes more stable material it does not have the longevity of pressure treated.  
											Pressure-treated lumber, southern yellow pine is a dense, heavyweight material with a mix of chemicals injected 
											into the lumber during a treatment process at the mill. The wood is environmentally safe and prevents rotting or 
											infestation from occurring during the life of the lumber. This provides for durability and longevity in custom 
											fences.  
											</p>
											
												<h3>What kind of warranty do you offer on my fence?</h3>
												
											<p>You will have a 5 year warranty on all workmanship on your new purchase.  However, we are 
											always glad to fix minor problems years after depending on the situation.  In addition, the materials used in the 
											installation of your fence or deck are covered by the manufacturer’s warranty. Please ask for specifics on the 
											product you choose.
											</p>
											
												<h3>Do you have payment options, or financing for projects?</h3>
											
											<p>We do offer financing for specific projects. Please speak with our management to determine if your project 
											qualifies for our financing program.</P>
											
												<h3>How should I care for my wood fence?</h3>
											
											<p>Although it seems obvious, we like to remind customers to use their gates with care and keep them closed 
											especially during harsh wind and storms. At three to six months: You should apply water repellent to aid the 
											pressure-treatment. For example: Thompson’s Water seal. It is important that a water repellent, coat of paint or 
											stain be applied after a fence dries out. This will reduce the amount of shrinkage & warping of materials. Repeat 
											every couple or so. Once a stain, paint or water repellent has been applied, no additional care is needed to 
											maintain the fence. Gate hardware may need to be checked occasionally. FBA does offer these 
											services.  With the proper care and attention, you can expect to enjoy years of satisfaction from your new fence!
											</p>
											
												<h3>How deep are your posts set?</h3>
											
											<p>We always try to set posts at the very minimum 18″ deep regardless of the type of fence/barrier/pole or 
											ground conditions, but sometimes 18″ is not feasible or necessary due to bed rock. In some cases we are happy to 
											have a 12″ depth in some rock. When the soil is “soft” we usually set posts 24″-30″ at the most shallow.
											</p>
											
												<h3>Why choose FBA?</h3>
											
											<p>Ask any one of our past customers. Attention to detail, and fast friendly services are our priority. We aim 
											to do this while also offer a fair price without gimmicks and phony pricing schemes. We treat each customer as 
											we would want to be treated! Find out for yourself!
											</p>
											
												<h3>Fence installation</h3>
											
											<p>All of our fence installation projects are custom fabricated on site to match the existing contour of each 
											homeowner’s yard, allowing the fence to roll in flowing manner that stays consistent with the slope of the land.
											We take pride in our design to ensure that spacing between posts, framing runners, and pickets are even and uniform. 
											Whether it’s a 4 foot picket or 8 foot privacy fence we maintain the habit of also making our vertical support posts 
											and pickets plumb and our horizontal board members level and/or parallel. Attention to detail and symmetric consistency are 
											one of the many assets that sets FBA apart from our competitors. </p>
											
												<h3>Commonly used lumber dimensions</h3>
												
											<p>VERTICAL SUPPORT POSTS<br>
											4”x4” finished at 3.5”x3.5”<br>
											6”x6” finished at 5.5”x5.5”<br>
											Horizontal Framing Runners<br>
											2”x4” finished at 1.5”x1.5”<br>
											2”x6” finished at 1.5”x5.5”<br><br>
											VERTICAL PICKETS<br>
											1”x6”x6’ finished at 5/8”x6”x6’<br>
											1”x6”x8’ finished at 5/8”x6”x8’<br>
											1”x4”x4’ finished at 5/8”x4”x4’<br>
											</p>
											
												<h3>6 FOOT PRIVACY FENCE</h3>
												
											<p>We dig our 4×4 post footer holes for 6 and 4 foot tall fences 18 to 24 inches deep and 8 inches wide. We add 60 
											pounds of concrete per hole and let it set for one to three days before we frame depending on the weather. Then to frame 
											the fence we fasten three (two for 4 foot and four for 8 foot tall fences) 2×4 horizontal runners for 6 foot fences with 3 
											inch galvanized zinc coated shanked framing nails or 3 inch wood screws. Last fasten the pickets one by one with 2 inch nails or
											screws. </p>
